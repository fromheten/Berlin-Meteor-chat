67 LOC and a fully functional chat app
======================================

This is a chat server/client I live coded for the Berlin HTML5 meetup in april 2013. It's live at [hello_berlin_meteorites.meteor.com](http://hello_berlin_meteorites.meteor.com/)!

To get started, have node installed, do `curl https://install.meteor.com | sh
` and `git clone` in your shell and then, in the app directory, do `meteor`. Simple.
